Was a principle leader in shaping and implementing the API/backend design of the core application's more-UX focused reboot as a RESTful, more unit-testable API. Provided mentoring and assistance for other developers in algorithms, troubleshooting and design. Was a leading contributer to the new rule-based dynamic content service's early development project. Received the peer nominated, management approved Roller of the year award in 2011. The majority of development was done in C# 4.0 in ASP.NET MVC3 (TDD, Repo pattern, IoC => DI, MVC3 as a JSON REST API), WCF (service per-request, custom handlers and behavior, SOAP, WebApi and CodePlex WCF Web API), and JavaScript (closures, prototypical inheritance and JSMVC).",
